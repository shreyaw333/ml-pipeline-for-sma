ML Pipeline for Social Media Analysis
Overview
This project provides an end-to-end ML pipeline for continuous social media analysis. The pipeline automates the ingestion, processing, and analysis of social media data to:
Perform sentiment analysis


Detect emerging trends


Provide real-time monitoring & visualization


Scale automatically to optimize cost & performance


It integrates big data processing, machine learning, container orchestration, and monitoring tools into one cohesive system.

Architecture

(Replace with generated diagram â€” currently a placeholder)
Workflow:
Data Ingestion


Social media API connectors (e.g., Reddit, Instagram, Twitter/X)


Streaming via Kafka / Redis


Stored in PostgreSQL / MongoDB


Data Processing


Batch + streaming ETL


Apache Spark for large-scale transformations & feature engineering


Model Training & Inference


TensorFlow models for:


Sentiment Analysis (positive, negative, neutral)


Trend Detection (hashtags & topics)


Supports versioning and continuous retraining


Pipeline Orchestration


Apache Airflow DAGs to schedule, trigger, and monitor workflows


Task parallelization via Celery


Deployment & Scaling


Docker containers for reproducibility


Kubernetes for orchestration + auto-scaling


Monitoring & Visualization


Prometheus & Grafana for system metrics


Flask Dashboard for live pipeline insights


Integration with BI tools (Tableau, Power BI, Looker Studio)

Setup
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/shreyaw333/ml-pipeline-for-sma.git
cd ml-pipeline-for-sma

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
